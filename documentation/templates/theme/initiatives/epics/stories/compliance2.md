As a website owner, I want to make sure that my website is compliant with GDPR regulations, so that I can avoid legal fines and protect my customers' privacy.

# List of Tasks related to this item
1) Scan website for GDPR compliance: The user would need to input the website URL into the GDPR scanner and run a scan to detect any potential GDPR violations.
2) Identify areas of non-compliance: The GDPR scanner would need to analyze the website for specific issues such as cookie usage, data collection and processing, and privacy policy compliance.
3) Provide a report of findings: After the scan is complete, the GDPR scanner would generate a report outlining any areas of non-compliance, as well as recommendations for how to bring the website into compliance with GDPR regulations.
