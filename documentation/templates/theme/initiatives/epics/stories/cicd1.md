As a product owner, I want to ensure that the software is of high quality by having automated tests in place to catch any regressions.

# List of Tasks related to this item

1) Set up a staging environment for testing and deployment
2) Implement version control for the software to enable easy rollback in case of issues
3) Define build and deployment processes: The user would need to define the build and deployment processes that will be automated by the CI/CD pipeline, including compiling code, running tests, and deploying to a staging or production environment.
4) Write automated tests: The user would need to write automated tests that will be run as part of the CI/CD pipeline to ensure that code changes do not introduce new errors or bugs.
5) Continuously improve the pipeline: The user would need to continuously improve the CI/CD pipeline by adding new tests, optimizing build and deployment processes, and incorporating feedback from users and team members.
