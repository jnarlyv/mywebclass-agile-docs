Improve the efficiency of the deployment process through comprehensive automated testing

Description: Implement automated testing tools and processes to ensure that software changes can be safely and quickly deployed to production environments

Goals: Reduce the risk of errors or bugs in production environments and to accelerate the deployment process

Scope: 
  1) Select and implement automated testing tools and processes
  2) Designing and execute test cases
  3) Integrate testing into the overall deployment process

Outcomes:
  1) Reduce time-to-market for new features and bug fixes
  2) Increase customer satisfaction
  3) Improved product quality
  4) Reduce costs associated with manual testing 

Deliverables: Create comprehensive automated test that involve integration with a continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD)

Milestones: 
  1) Documentation outlining the testing process - 1 month
  2) Select test cases - 2 weeks

Constraints: 
  1) Software limitation
  2) Budget limitation

Assumptions: Automated test will identify error

Risks: 
  1) Incomplete and inadequate test coverage
  2) Potential negative impact on user experience

Dependencies:  Availability of resources to implement and maintain the automated testing process and the integration of testing with the overall deployment

Team: Web development team
