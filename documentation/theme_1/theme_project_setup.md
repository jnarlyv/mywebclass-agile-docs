## Test Plan
1) Use tools like Google PageSpeed Insights and Pingdom to test the website's performance.
2) Test the website's search engine optimization (SEO) by checking its visibility on search engines like Google and Bing.
3) Conduct user acceptance testing by getting feedback from real users to ensure that the website meets their needs and expectations.
4) Use GDPR Scanner to ensure the website is in compliance with GDPR requirements.
